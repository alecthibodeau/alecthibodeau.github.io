## Code Portfolio site

I'm a software developer specializing in the front end, the user experience (UX), user interfaces (UI), digital accessibility and responsive web design. I build front-end websites from scratch. With a background in art I can make design elements and website prototypes myself or collaborate directly with UX designers.

My personal coding projects include websites built with React and TypeScript. These are live and interactive â€” and their code is viewable here at GitHub under my pinned repositories. I also handle the UX and UI design for these sites: with features like semantic HTML, accessible elements, mobile-first responsiveness and custom color palettes.
