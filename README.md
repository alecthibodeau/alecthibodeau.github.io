## Code Portfolio site

I'm a software developer and a visual artist, focusing on front-end web development, the user experience (UX), user interfaces (UI), digital accessibility and responsive web design. I'm happy to craft design elements and website prototypes myself or collaborate directly with UX designers.

My personal coding projects include websites built with React and TypeScript. These are live and interactive â€” and their code is viewable here at GitHub under my pinned repositories. I also handle the UX and UI design for these sites: with features like semantic HTML, accessible elements, mobile-first responsiveness and custom color palettes.

## Technology Features

This site is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Other features include:
- Accessibility
  - [Level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AAA-Conformance) color contrast values
  - Semantic HTML tags
  - Responsive web design (mobile-first)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com)
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com)
- Custom SVG illustrations
